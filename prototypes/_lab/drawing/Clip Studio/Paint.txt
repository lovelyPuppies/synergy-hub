        Easily integrate hand-drawing into your designs with dedicated drawing tools and functions.
        Let's get started.

        - First, set the pen pressure with the wizard
          Set your pen pressure curve automatically with a few strokes.
          Access the full range of your pen tablet's hardness and softness with this simple procedure.
          You can fine-tune these settings at any time if you're not satisfied.

        - Expressive pens for all your creation needs
          Customize your pen’s line weight, analog feel, texture, and more to suit your style.
          Use preset brushes for an expedient solution, import Photoshop dual brushes (ABR), and create combined brushstrokes, or head to Clip Studio Assets to choose from a wide range of unique custom brushes from the Clip Studio Paint user community and grab whatever you need!

        - Draw exactly as you imagine
          Use the inbuilt stabilization functions to draw clean, accurate lines without shakiness or wavering, exactly how you’re picturing your creation.

        - Fix vectors when and how you want
          Experience new freedom with vector layers - layers that allow you to edit lines after you’ve drawn them without affecting the line quality.
          You can move lines, make them thicker, thinner, erase only one line, or erase to intersections.

        - Ideal resolution for printing and publishing
          With vectors, drawings stay high-quality and free of distortion, even when resized.
          With Clip Studio Paint, post your creations to the web, print posters and other large-scale formats and more with no loss in image quality.


      2. Drawing: Advanced
        Designers are called on to give shape to ideas on tight deadlines.
        Clip Studio Paint is packed with features to get your designs on the page quickly and easily.

        - Clip Studio Paint makes human figures a breeze
          To show the relationship between the design and users, sketches often include hands and people in specific poses.
          Clip Studio Paint's adjustable 3D figures allow you to freely change pose, proportions, and body type as needed.
          You can also attach props to your 3D model like hats and shoes, to instantly create a reference close to your character design.

        - 3D support for drawing faces
          Create your very own facial reference with our adjustable head model.
          Fine-tune overall shape, eyes, nose, eyebrows, ears, mouth, and other parts.
          The base head can also be transformed into various styles, such as realistic, chibi, and anime.

        - AI posing from photographs
          AI features enabled by deep learning algorithms enables you to simply scan a photograph and let Clip Studio Paint automatically pose your 3D drawing figure to match.

        - Perfect prototyping with 3D models
          Import your own files or download pre-made buildings, furniture, crowds, vehicles, and many other materials that are ideal for use in prototyping work.

        - View 3D materials from all angles at once
          When placing a 3D material, you can view from four angles simultaneously.
          You can also change the position of the camera and the focal point on the 3D layer.
          When you change the camera position from the All sides view palette, the model also adjusts on the canvas.

        - Incorporate photos and 3D assets into projects
          Extract edges and colors from photos and 3D models and create a base for drawing and painting to boost efficiency and put a personal touch on works.

        - Convert photos to illustrations
          Photos can also be converted into painterly styles with the Artistic filter.
          With EX, you can extract 3D assets and images into separate line and tone layers.

        - A ruler for every occasion
          Draw accurate lines using high-quality rulers.
          Use perspective rulers that snap lines to vanishing points, symmetry rulers that are perfect for pattern making, and circle rulers for clean ovals, and much more.


      3. Painting & Decorating;  Clients often have their own tastes in what they’re expecting from artists.
        Clip Studio Paint offers better flexibility to keep clients happy, with deeply customizable drawing and editing tools.

        - Brushes for every taste
          Clip Studio Paint's brushes are highly customizable, letting users tailor strength, randomness, texture and more.
          If you're in a hurry, Clip Studio Assets puts unique, quality brushes at your fingertips anytime.

        - Color quick with smart fill tools
          Clip Studio Paint’s fill tools are smart enough to fill spaces without spillover, even if there are gaps in lines.

        - Gradients how you want them
          Efficiently create gradients with multiple dedicated tools.
          Create your basic gradient with the Gradient tool, control the shape of your gradients with the Contour line paint tool, or apply colors based on a gradient and values.

        - Realistic color mixing
          From precise color mixing to running paint and wet watercolor style brushes, experience realistic color mixing rarely seen in digital software.
          Ver 2.0 allows for more natural color mixing while maintaining color brightness.

        - Go wild with patterns! - Hundreds of decoration brushes
          Draw repeating textures such as chains, accessories, textile patterns, and flowers with a single stroke.
          Multiple images can be applied to a single brush and randomized for a natural result.

        - AI Colorization
          Compare color schemes with AI-based automatic colorization.

        - Smooth color selection
          In addition to the usual circles and sliders, Clip Studio Paint comes with four other color palettes: Color Sets, Approximate Color, Intermediate Colors, and Color History.
          Create original color sets, or import swatches as color sets...
          All these features combine to make color selection smooth, efficient, and enjoyable!

        - Make colors your way
          Fine-tune hue, saturation, brightness, and luminance to create a specific color, map out the intermediate colors of four colors, and track the variation of a single color without all the guesswork.

        - Selection can be made efficiently
          Selection tools abound in Clip Studio Paint.
          Choose from the basic rectangle, circle, lasso, polyline, advanced selection pen, erase selection and more, or try the unique Shrink Selection that selects enclosed areas inside of the selection.



      4. Finishing & Editing ;  With Clip Studio Paint’s non-destructive effects and filters, apply textures and effects, or compare patterns to test and refine your finishing touches.

        - Text
          Add, rotate, tilt text, edit line and word spacing, flip vertically and horizontally, justify, arrange it in relation to the text box, adjust kerning, arrange text in a circle, and combine multiple fonts.
          Font ligatures can be used to create designs with text seamlessly.
        - Arrange and Align
          Handy alignment and distribution features are a must for web and graphic design! Multiple objects such as drawings, text, balloons, and frame borders can be aligned together or neatly arranged with equal spacing.

        - Simple layer effects
          Non-destructively apply textures, outlines, watercolor border effects and more to layers, or convert them into screentone dots.
          Transform any image into a halftone format for black-and-white printing, or to simulate classic comic and pop art.

        - Get expressive with blending modes
          Use blending modes on your layers to add a variety of interesting effects to your image.
          Select from 29 blending modes to create specific effects or compositions.

        - Precise adjustments with Liquify
          Make precise adjustments with the Liquify tool
          Intuitively push and pull parts of the drawing without affecting its texture or brushwork.
          Select multiple layers to liquify them all at once.

        - Experiment endlessly with Tonal Correction Layers
          Use Tonal Correction Layers to add finishing touches.
          Leaving the original layer untouched, you can adjust brightness, contrast, hue, saturation and luminosity, or apply posterization, level correction, tone curve, color balance, gradation map, and more.

        - Boost quality with filters
          Use a filter to blur, sharpen, add noise, mosaic and more to add effects to your piece.
          Make your images look like photos with a retro film filter combining chromatic aberration with noise.
          Or go with the hand-drawn pencil look with a pencil filter.
          More filters mean more ways to express yourself easily!

        - Image resolution up-conversion
          Resample images and erase jpeg noise to reuse your past work as a larger image.

      - Adjustable pen pressure

      - The perfect line
        Drawing clean lines can be challenging, but you can make it easier with stabilization and correction features.

      - Fix vectors when and how you want
        Draw vector lines the same as you would on paper.
        Move, thicken, thin, selectively erase individual brushstrokes up to an intersection, or watch them in 4K without deteriorating their quality.

        Use 3D references for accurate compositions.
        Import your own 3D models, or download architecture, furniture, humans, vehicles, and more to create a wide variety of scenes.

        Simple 3D primitive shapes can be set up as a reference base for drawing objects and scenes, or used as building blocks for more complex compositions.
        You can also import normal maps to express realistic textures such as mesh and cloth.

      - View 3D materials from all angles at once
        When placing a 3D material, you can view from four angles simultaneously.

        Draw repeating textures such as chains, accessories, textile patterns, and flowers with a single stroke.
        Multiple images can be applied to a single brush and randomized for a natural result.
        Multiple images can be set for a repeated pattern, so you can create a natural description that is not monotonous.

      - Complex gradients made simple
        Use the gradient tool to set multiple colors and transparency in a single, detailed, and natural gradient or use the contour line fill tool to create gradients that follow a specific shape.





    2. Animating;  No animation can be made without the frames between keyframes.
      Clip Studio Paint comes with functions that allow you to reference multiple frames and more, all to create a better animation.

      - Drawing frames between keyframes
        Use the light table function to freely reference specific keyframes while inbetweening.

      - Display previous and following frames
        Want to add more frames? Use the onion skin function to overlay the previous and following frames for reference with full control over the color and number of layers.
      - Checking movement
        Just like flipping paper, use the keyboard to cycle through your completed frames.



    3. Directing;  With Clip Studio Paint, you can edit, adjust the timing of each frame, add camera work, and audio to your animation without switching programs.

      - Adjustable playback
        Set the timing and order of each frame in multiple tracks, and adjust playback speed as needed.

      - Customizable camerawork
        Clip Studio Paint offers keyframe options for objects and camera movement.
        With multiple interpolation options, you can set sharp movements or smooth curved motions, and check the movement with the camera path display.

      - Audio file compatibility
        Add, adjust, and mix multiple music tracks, sound effects, and voices.
        Playback audio tracks on the timeline to match animation and sound.


    4. Exporting;  Choose the best format for your project from multiple export options.
      - Export as an image sequence
        Export frames of the entire animation as a flattened image sequence, for complete control over scale and framerate.
        *Available formats: PNG, BMP, JPEG, Targa, TIFF

      - Export individual tracks
        Each track can be exported as an individual image sequence.
        The export range can be set to specific borders as well.
        *Available formats: PNG, BMP, JPEG, Targa, TIFF

      - GIF export
        Quickly share animation snippets and test animations online as lightweight, accessible GIF files, even with transparency.

      - Video export
        Export finished animations as video files such as MP4.

        Speed up your workflow, create backups of your workspace of choice, and create the best art you can with the help of Clip Studio Paint.

      - Optimize your workspace
        Save and share your customized palette layout, shortcuts, command bar, and colors as workspaces, and use them whenever you need them.

      - Template and workspace sharing
        Save and share file settings and layer structures as templates, or share your workspace with your team and unify your environments.

      - Streamline repetitive operations
        Perform frequent or repeated operations with one click using Auto Actions.
        Customize shortcuts and recreate your favorite shortcuts from other programs.
        Shortcuts can be customized, and you can change them to other familiar shortcuts with other software.

  📰 구상 -> 러프 -> 선화 -> 채색 -> 보정
    📹 러프를 그리는 좋은 방법들/클립스튜디오/신타선생님 ; https://youtu.be/KbiaRLmg_78 📅 2024-05-12 22:25:42
      키워드 1. 줄여라
        러프의 크기를 줄여라.
          구체적/세세하게 퀄리티높게 그리기 위해서 확대하는 경우가 많은데, 그림 전체보다 그림의 일부분만 보게 되어
            - 그리는 시간이 많아지고
            - 인체의 밸런스가 깨지고
            - 같은 그림 내에서 퀄리티 차이가 날 가능성이 커진다.
          러프 자체 크기를 줄이고, 캔버스를 축소해서 일단은 형태를 알아볼 수 있을 정도만 그린다. 대충 그린 것처럼 보여도 상관없다.
        러프의 규모를 줄여라.
          그림 실력이 상대적으로 떨어지면, 간단한것만 그리는 것이 더 낫다.
          캐릭터+배경+그 이외 다른 것들을 그니느 것보다 캐릭터 하나에 집중하는 것이 낫다.
          🚣 러프를 그리면서 천천히 늘려가는 형태로 그리도록 한다.
            본인의 페이스를 유지하며, 점점 이 한계를 늘려나가야 한다.
        캐릭터의 퀄리티를 줄여라.
          러프를 SD 캐릭터, 막대인간 등 표현하고 싶은 것을 자잘하게 간소화해서 그리도록 한다.
          미리보기이기 때문에 굳이 LD 로 진행하지 않아도 좋다.
            이렇게 하면 추가적인 작업이 필요하긴 하지만, 빠르고 간단하게 추가/수정을 할 수 있어서 이런 방식으로 여러 번을 시도해보는 것이 좋다.
          러프에서 시간을 많이 쓰면 안된다.
      키워드 2. 늘려라
        러프의 숫자를 늘려라.
          러프를 여러번 그려서 잘못된 점이나 섬세함을 많이 필요한 곳을 생각하면서 바로잡도록 해본다.
          특히 캐주얼 일러스트를 그릴 때 특정 부분들을 섬세하게 그려야 하는 중요하다.
          🚣 러프를 반투명한 상태로 만든 후, 이 위에 새로운 레이어를 만들고 그 위에서 작업하는 것.
            그래서 1차, 2차 3차.. n차 러프까지 그린다.
        러프의 양을 늘려라.
          같은 주제라 할 지라도 비슷한 여러 자세를 그려보도록 한다.
          🚣 어떤 상황에 놓여있는지, 어떤 포즈를 취하는 지, 어떤 이유로 그 행동을 하고 있는지에 따라 그림의 분위기가 확연하게 달라진다.
        리프를 그리는 여유를 가져라. 조급한 마음으로 그리지는 말자.
      키워드 2. 넓혀라
        러프를 그릴 때 시야를 넓혀라
        사용하는 툴에서 러프를 그릴 떄 유용한 것을 최대한 사용하자.
        🛍️ e.g. 클립스튜디오
          내장되어있는 3D - Pose (인형) 을 사용하면 인체를 그릴 때 도움이 된다.
          픽셀유동화 기능을 사용하여 러프의 잘못된 부분을 바로잡을 수 있다.
