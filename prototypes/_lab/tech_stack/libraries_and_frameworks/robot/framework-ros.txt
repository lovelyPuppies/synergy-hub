⭕ Use "catkin build" (package: python3-catkin-tools) instead of "catkin_make" 📅 2025-01-09 15:17:27
  - Improved build output
    "catkin build" provides cleaner and color-coded output, making it easier to understand build progress, warnings, and errors at a glance.
  - Better performance with parallel builds
    "catkin build" optimizes build times by efficiently handling parallel builds, especially in large workspaces with multiple packages.
  - Advanced package management
    It allows selective builds (build specific packages only) and offers more flexible workspace configurations.
  - Dedicated log management
    Logs for each package are stored separately, making it easier to debug build issues without cluttered output.
  - Modern and actively maintained
    "catkin build" is part of the catkin_tools package, which is more actively maintained and better suited for modern ROS workflows compared to "catkin_make".

(✍️ ROS 1 🔪 study)
  🚨 (Issue: Error); Running ROS commands in Container exhausts memory 📅 2025-01-15 11:28:59
    ❔➡️ Workaround:
        - Set Hard limit to docker-compose.yml, and fluidly adjust Soft limit in a shell session.
          🛍️ e.g. 

            ```yaml
            # 🗄️ docker-compose.yml
            services:
              app:
                ulimits:
                  # Maximum number of processes a single node or process can create in multi-process systems like ROS.
                  nproc: 65535
                  nofile:
                    ## Error: services.app.ulimits.nofile soft is required 📅 2025-01-14 21:55:00
                    # 🚨 (Issue: Bug): ulimit soft not working in devcontainer from docker-compose.yml. 📅 2025-01-15 09:27:03
                    #   However, when using `docker compose up` and `exec` to access the container, soft settings are applied as expected.

                    # Maximum number of file descriptors a process can use at a time, including files, sockets, pipes, and other resources.
                    soft: 1024
                    hard: 524288
            ```
            Or, Or, set the same limits for each terminal session.
            ```bash
            #!/usr/bin/bash
            ulimit -Hn 524288   # 4 MiB
            ulimit -Sn 1024     # 1 KiB
            ```

          📝 Explanation of memory calculation:
            - Each `pollfd` structure consumes 8 bytes.
            - For 524,288 file descriptors:
              - Memory consumption = 524,288 file descriptors × 8 bytes = 4,194,304 bytes.
              - 4,194,304 bytes = 4 MiB (Mebibytes).

        - Check value using command 🧮 %shell> ulimit -Sn && ulimit -Hn

    ❔ When
        in Docker ROS 1 noetic container,

        1. in ROS master
          %shell> roscore
        2. in turtlebot 3, bring up 
          %shell> roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
        3. in ROS master
          %shell:fish> 
            rosrun rviz rviz -d (rospack find turtlebot3_description)/rviz/model.rviz
            # or 
            roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch

    ❔ Symptom
      The container consumes all available memory, often exceeding 8GB, causing the computer to freeze or crash
      , with all other programs exiting except the desktop environment.

    ❔🤔 Inference
      %shell> top
      
      Swap memory usage increases significantly, with some processes consuming up to 512 MiB per process.
      It seems that there is a memory leak in ROS 1.

      🚣 OOM Killer in action
        %shell> sudo dmesg | grep -i "out of memory"
        >> 
          [ 5143.550034] Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process 85970 (rosout) total-vm:8434156kB, anon-rss:7290240kB, file-rss:9788kB, shmem-rss:0kB, UID:1000 pgtables:14360kB oom_score_adj:0
          [ 5145.739000] Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process 86022 (rosout) total-vm:8434156kB, anon-rss:7283072kB, file-rss:9836kB, shmem-rss:0kB, UID:1000 pgtables:14344kB oom_score_adj:0

      
    ❔ Root Cause
      The core issue stems from the design of the XmlRpcServer in ROS, which handles asynchronous socket communication using the pollfd structure. This structure, defined in /usr/include/poll.h, is used to monitor file descriptors. The excessive memory consumption occurs due to the following reasons:

      - pollfd Structure and Memory Usage:
        The pollfd structure is defined as:
        ```c
        struct pollfd {
            int fd;           /* File descriptor to poll. */
            short int events; /* Requested events to watch. */
            short int revents; /* Returned events. */
        };
        ```

        Each pollfd occupies 8 bytes:
          - 4 bytes for the int field.
          - 2 bytes each for the short int fields.
          - Includes alignment padding for memory efficiency on 64-bit systems.

      - The XmlRpcServer initializes a 🚣 std::vector<pollfd> with a size equal to the system's file descriptor limit (ulimit -n).
        This design results in significant memory allocation.
        In many Docker container environments, this limit is often set to an extremely high value (same with Host system's value), such as 1,073,741,816.
        
        This leads to excessive memory allocation: ❗ 1,073,741,816 × 8 bytes = 8GB per ROS node.

        However, even in sufficient RAM environments, excessive pollfd allocation and communication overhead lead to memory exhaustion
          XML-RPC-Based Communication Overhead:
            - Node-to-node communication:
              Each rosrun or roslaunch instance establishes multiple network socket connections, increasing memory usage for sockets.
            - Message queues and buffers:
              Topic caches, data buffers, and message queues add additional memory overhead.
            - High swap memory usage:
              ❗ Observations show that even running roscore alone can result in processes consuming up to 512 MiB of swap memory per process.
              Swap memory usage spikes, further degrading system performance.

      10.🖇️⚓ Creating a ROS msg and srv ; https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv 📅 2025-01-09 16:18:05
        #️⃣ Introduction to 🪱 msg (message) and 🪱 srv (service); https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Creating_a_srv
          msg: msg files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message. They are used to generate source code for messages in different languages.
          srv: an srv file describes a service. It is composed of two parts: a 🪱 request and a response.
        #️⃣ Using msg ; https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Using_msg
          # Creating a msg
            %shell:fish> roscd beginner_tutorials && mkdir -p msg && echo "int64 num" > msg/Num.msg

            ⚠️ You may notice that sometimes your project builds fine even if you did not call find_package with all dependencies.
              This is because catkin combines all your projects into one, so if an earlier project calls find_package, yours is configured with the same values.
              But forgetting the call means your project can easily break when built in isolation.

        #️⃣ Using rosmsg ; https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Using_rosmsg
          ❕ %shell:fish> rosmsg show [message type]

          %shell:fish> rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num

          🚣 If you can't remember which Package a msg is in, you can leave out the package name. Try:
            %shell:fish> rosmsg show Num
        #️⃣ Using srv ; https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Using_srv
          #️⃣ Creating a srv ; https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Creating_a_srv

              roscd beginner_tutorials && mkdir srv && \
              roscp rospy_tutorials srv/AddTwoInts.srv srv/AddTwoInts.srv
            
            Unless you have done so already, open package.xml, and make sure these two lines are in it and uncommented ...
            ❕ As before, note that at build time, we need "message_generation", while at runtime, we only need "message_runtime".
            ❗ (Despite its name, message_generation works for both msg and srv.)

          #️⃣ Using rossrv ; https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Using_rossrv
            %shell:fish>
              rossrv show beginner_tutorials/AddTwoInts
              echo "========================="
              # Here, two services are shown. The first is the one you just created in the beginner_tutorials package, and the second is the pre-existing one from the rospy_tutorials package.
              rossrv show AddTwoInts
        #️⃣ Common step for msg and srv ; https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Common_step_for_msg_and_srv
          %shell:fish>
            roscd beginner_tutorials && cd ../.. && \
            catkin_make
            cd -
          Or, use catkin build (⭕ More Flexible! )
          %shell:fish>
            roscd beginner_tutorials && cd ../.. && \
            catkin build
            cd -

          https://wiki.ros.org/action/show/msg
          📍 Any .msg file in the msg directory will generate code for use in all supported languages. 
            # c++ files
            tree /workspacedevel/include
            # python files
            tree /workspace/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages
            # lisp files
            tree /workspace/devel/share/common-lisp
          ⚖️ Similarly, any .srv files in the srv directory will have generated code in supported languages.
            For C++, this will generate header files in the same directory as the message header files.
            For Python and Lisp, there will be an 'srv' folder beside the 'msg' folders.

            - roscd = ros+cd : changes directory to a ROS package or stack
            - rosls = ros+ls : lists files in a ROS package
            - roscp = ros+cp : copies files from/to a ROS package
            - rosmsg = ros+msg : provides information related to ROS message definitions
            - rossrv = ros+srv : provides information related to ROS service definitions
            - catkin_make : makes (compiles) a ROS package
              rosmake = ros+make : makes (compiles) a ROS package (if you're not using a catkin workspace)
            - ❗ catkin build: makes (compiles) a ROS package in an isolated manner while maintaining efficiency due to parallelisation
