  📝❗ Limitations 📅 2025-02-09 14:05:58    
    To use magic_enum::enum_name<E>(value), the following conditions must be met:
      1. E must be an enum type that is directly defined in C++.
      2. E must support static reflection, allowing magic_enum to recognize it.
    However, enums generated by Protobuf are not standard C++ enums. 
      They are internally transformed into a special type by Protobuf, which magic_enum does not recognize by default.
