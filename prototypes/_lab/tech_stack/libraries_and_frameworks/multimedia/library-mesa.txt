        Generic Buffer Management (GBM) is an API that provides a mechanism for allocating buffers for graphics rendering tied to Mesa.
        GBM is intended to be used as a native platform for 🪱 EGL (Embedded Graphics Library) on 🪱 DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) or 🪱 openwfd (Open Windowing Foundation Display).
        The handle it creates can be used to initialize EGL and to create render target buffers.
