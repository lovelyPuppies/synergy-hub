    🪱 Recipes: Provides details about particular pieces of software.
    🪱 Class Data: Abstracts common build information (e.g. how to build a Linux kernel).
    🪱 Configuration Data: Defines machine-specific settings, policy decisions, and so forth. Configuration data acts as the glue to bind everything together.

    #️⃣📎 Build Directory ; https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/terms.html#term-Build-Directory
      The 🪱 TOPDIR variable points to the Build Directory.

      ⚠️ Note
        By default, the Build Directory contains TMPDIR, which is a temporary directory the build system uses for its work.
        TMPDIR cannot be under NFS. Thus, by default, the Build Directory cannot be under NFS.
        However, if you need the Build Directory to be under NFS, you can set this up by setting TMPDIR in your local.conf file to use a local drive.
        ⭕📰 Doing so effectively separates TMPDIR from TOPDIR, which is the Build Directory.

        ; 🪱 oe: OpenEmbedded
        When you run this script, your Yocto Project environment is set up, a 🪱 Build Directory is created
        , your working directory becomes the Build Directory, and you are presented with some simple suggestions as to what to do next
        , including a list of some possible targets to build. 
        
        The default output of the oe-init-build-env script is from the 🪱 conf-summary.txt and 🪱 conf-notes.txt files
        , which are found in the meta-poky directory within the 🪱 Source Directory.
        💡 If you design a custom distribution, you can include your own versions of these configuration files where you can provide a brief summary and detailed usage notes
        , such as a list of the targets defined by your distribution.
        https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/custom-template-configuration-directory.html#creating-a-custom-template-configuration-directory

        The OpenEmbedded build system uses the template configuration files, which are found by default in the meta-poky/conf/templates/default directory in the Source Directory. 
          https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/custom-template-configuration-directory.html#creating-a-custom-template-configuration-directory
        
        ⚠️ Note
          The OpenEmbedded build system does not support file or directory names that contain spaces.
