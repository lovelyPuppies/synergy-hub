        ü™± SDDM (Simple Desktop Display Manager) is the default display manager used in KDE-based distributions like Kubuntu.
        It manages graphical logins and sessions.
        
        In this function, SDDM is responsible for launching the Xorg server, which creates the Xauthority file required for graphical authentication.
        This script locates and copies that file.       
    '
    # Use pgrep to find the Xorg process and extract the path to the Xauthority file

    set xauth_path (pgrep -a Xorg | awk -F '-auth ' '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}')

    # If the path is empty, print an error message and exit with a failure code
    if test -z "$xauth_path"
        echo "Error: Unable to find Xauthority file path. Is the X server running?"
