  âš“ Null modem ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_modem
    Null modem is a communication method to directly connect two DTEs (computer, terminal, printer, etc.) using an RS-232 serial cable.
  âš“ Data terminal equipment (DTE) ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_terminal_equipment
    | data processing terminal equipment | tail circuit
    ... is an end instrument that converts user information into signals or reconverts received signals.
      A DTE device communicates with the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE), such as a modem.
      The DTE/DCE classification was introduced by IBM.
  âš“ Data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_circuit-terminating_equipment
    | data communication(s) equipment | data carrier equipment
    ...  is a device that sits between the data terminal equipment (DTE) and a data transmission circuit. 
      Usually, the DTE device is the terminal (or computer), and the DCE is a modem.
