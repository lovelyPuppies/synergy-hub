- The `or` operator only executes the command following it if the previous command fails (non-zero exit status).
- The `and` operator only executes the command following it if the previous command succeeds (zero exit status).
- In this script, `or echo "Bye"` does not execute because `echo Hi` succeeded. 
  This is the expected (successful) behavior, meaning the fact that `echo "Bye"` is not executed is the correct and intended outcome.
- Since `or echo "Bye"` is not executed as expected, the `and` operator runs its command ("I don\'t want this operation when in success operation, but performed.")
  because the previous command did not trigger the `or` clause, allowing the `and` to execute as part of the intended flow.
- The execution of the `and` command is therefore normal and expected, as the non-execution of the `or` clause confirms the intended success.
