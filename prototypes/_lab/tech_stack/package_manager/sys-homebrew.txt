⚠️ Caution in Linux 📅 2024-11-23 21:48:15
  ❌ Avoid installing packages like Tailscale, openssh via Homebrew on Linux if they require `sudo` permissions or need to operate as a system service.

  On macOS, Homebrew effectively manages such services using `brew services`, which relies on macOS's built-in service management (likely `launchd`). However, on Linux, services are typically managed using `systemctl`, and Homebrew does not integrate seamlessly with it. This difference can lead to errors. For example:

  - When running "systemctl daemon-reload":
    Failed to execute /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/systemd/256.8/bin/pkttyagent: No such file or directory

  - When running "tailscaled":
    Reload daemon failed: Access denied

  These issues occur because Homebrew on Linux installs packages in user directories (e.g., `/home/linuxbrew/`) without the necessary system-level permissions to manipulate services.  

  For Linux, it’s recommended to install such packages using the system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`) to ensure proper integration with `systemctl`.

* 🚨 (Issue: Bug); brew breaks sudo password cache 📅 2024-12-09 02:48:31
  Description
    Homebrew forces re-authentication for sudo commands, ignoring the sudo password cache and requiring repeated password inputs.

  When
    The issue occurs during Homebrew commands executed in the Fish shell:
      Example steps to reproduce:
        sudo -v
        echo First
        brew install tree
        sudo -v
        echo Two
    The problem persists regardless of the following /etc/sudoers configurations:
      Defaults !tty_tickets
      Defaults timestamp_timeout=30

  Explanation
    ➡️ > This is likely a WONTFIX, sorry. We clear the sudo password cache intentionally as a precaution against privilege escalation attacks.
