    - Reactor Pattern
      The application 🚣 directly checks for I/O events by calling an event monitoring function.
      → If the data is ready to be read, the application 🚣 directly executes the 🪱 Completion Handler, which then calls read().

    - Proactor Pattern
      The application requests an asynchronous read operation, and the OS 🚣 directly performs the read (read() completes).
      → Once the read operation is finished, the OS 🚣 directly executes the 🪱 Completion Handler.

    🗒️ Contents
      The reactor software design pattern is an event handling strategy that can respond to many potential service requests concurrently.
      🔑 The pattern's key component is an 🪱 event loop, running in a single thread or process, which 🪱 demultiplexes incoming requests and dispatches them to the correct request handler.
        By relying on event-based mechanisms rather than blocking I/O or multi-threading, a reactor can handle many concurrent I/O bound requests with minimal delay.
      ❗ A reactor also allows for easily modifying or expanding specific request handler routines, though the pattern does have some drawbacks and limitations.
        🌳 Derivations such as the 🪱 multireactor and 🪱 proactor also exist for special cases where even greater throughput, performance, or request complexity are necessary.
      
      #️⃣📍 Structure ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#Structure
        # Handle
        # Demultiplexer
          An 🪱 event notifier that can efficiently monitor the status of a handle, then notify other subsystems of a relevant status change (typically an IO handle becoming 🪱 "ready to read").
          ⭕ Traditionally this role was filled by the select() system call, but more contemporary examples include 🪱 epoll, kqueue, and IOCP.

  ⚓🖇️ Proactor pattern ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactor_pattern 📅 2025-02-09 05:41:30
    🗒️ Contents
      Proactor is a software design pattern for event handling in which long running activities are running in an asynchronous part.
      A 🪱 completion handler is called after the asynchronous part has terminated. 

      #️⃣ Interaction ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactor_pattern#Interaction
        Operation specific actors:
          - 1. The Proactive Initiator starts the asynchronous operation via the Asynchronous Operation Processor and defines the Completion Handler
          - 5. Completion Handler is a call at the end of the operation from the Asynchronous Operation Processor
          - 3. Asynchronous Operation
        Standardized actors
          - 2. The Asynchronous Operation Processor controls the whole asynchronous operation
          - 4. The Completion Dispatcher handles the call, depending on the execution environment.

  ⚓📎 Thread pool ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool

    🗒️ Contents
      ... ❗ a thread pool maintains multiple threads waiting for tasks to be allocated for concurrent execution by the supervising program.
        ❗ By maintaining a pool of threads, the model increases performance and avoids latency in execution due to frequent creation and destruction of threads for short-lived tasks

    2 📍 Comparison to MVC
      📝 &comment
        기존 MVC 패턴의 controller 의 역할은 다음과 같다.
          ... Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view. ... (from MVC pattern in Wikipedia)
        실제로 저 역할 뿐이므로 modern web server 에서는 저렇게 분류하기보다는 하나의 요청마다 closures 를 형성하여 SOLID 원칙도 지키기 때문에 ADR 로 구성하는 것이 더 좋은 정제된 패턴이다.
        예를 들어 내가 한 gs_store 을 보면
          - (frontend 에서의 요청, 단순 API) 마다 받은 json data 를 class instance 의 attribute 처럼 접근이 가능하도록 json.loads(json.dumps(request.get_json()), object_hook=lambda d: SimpleNamespace(**d)) 를 사용하고, 
          - SOLID 의 단일 책임 원칙을 지킬 수 있도록 Data Tranfer Object 를 반환하는 클래스를 각 요청마다 정의하고, instnace attributes 를 json 형태로 반환할 수 있도록 return vars( <instantiating> ) 한다.
          - Then, until the request for instantiation of each class that creates DTO, it becomes "Action"
            , the internal logic for generating a response in each request becomes "Domain"
            , and the defined class that works to make the result into an HTTP response including to draw into frontend is "Responder". (to allocate value into self.attribute variable)
        다른 MVP, MVVM 패턴은 똑같이 웹의 기능은 같지만 part 를 다르게 나눈 것으로 생각하면 된다. 나눠진 부분으로 개별적으로 개발이 가능하도록 구현한 implementation 예시를 참조하자.
        ⚓ No more MVC ; https://dev.to/mustardsauce/no-more-mvc-4l97
          ⚓ Paul M. Jones ; https://github.com/pmjones
          + So what's wrong with Model-View-Controller?
            MVC was originally a design pattern for desktop graphical user interfaces. It has many different interpretations (try Google for definition), many similar/different successors like MVP or MVVM. However it does not describe well how (server-side!) web-app architecture looks like. That's why pmjones comes with refinement of the term MVC for web purposes.
      - MVC controllers usually contain several methods that, when combined in a single class, require additional logic to handle properly, like pre- and post-action hooks. Each ADR action, however, is represented by separate classes or closures.
    
    ⚓ Model-View-Controller, MVC ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller
      2 Components
        - Model
          The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, 💡 independent of the user interface.[10] It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
        - View
          Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
        - Controller
          Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
    ⚓ Model-view-presenter, MVP ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter
      2 Overview
        MVP is a user interface architectural pattern engineered to facilitate automated unit testing and improve the separation of concerns in presentation logic:
          - The model is an interface defining the data to be displayed or otherwise acted upon in the user interface.
          - The view is a note passive interface that displays data (the model) and routes user commands (events) to the presenter to act upon that data.
          - The presenter acts upon the model and the view. It retrieves data from repositories (the model), and formats it for display in the view.

      3 Implementations
        ...
        3.2 Java
          r... 💡 In a Java (AWT/Swing/SWT) application, the MVP pattern can be used by letting the user interface class implement a view interface.
          The same approach can be used for Java web-based applications, since modern Java component-based Web frameworks allow development of client-side logic using the same component approach as thick clients.
          Implementing MVP in Google Web Toolkit requires only that some component implement the view interface. The same approach is possible using Vaadin or the Echo2 Web framework. ...r

  ⚓📎⭕ Publish-subscribe pattern ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern

      Kafka can connect to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect, and provides the Kafka Streams libraries for stream processing applications.
      Kafka uses a binary TCP-based protocol that is optimized for efficiency and relies on a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together to reduce the overhead of the network roundtrip.
