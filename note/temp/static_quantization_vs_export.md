# Differences Between Manual Static Quantization and `export(int8=True)`

This document outlines the key differences between **manual static quantization** in PyTorch and using the high-level API function `model.export(int8=True)`. The choice between these two approaches depends on your need for customization, control, and deployment scenarios. Below is a summary of each approach, highlighting the strengths, limitations, and use cases.

## 1. Control and Customization

- **Manual Static Quantization**:
  - Provides **fine-grained control** over which layers are quantized and how the quantization is applied (e.g., symmetric or asymmetric quantization).
  - Requires **calibration** for activation statistics to ensure optimal performance after quantization.
  - Ideal when targeting **specific hardware backends** or models with **non-standard architectures** that require fine-tuning.

- **`model.export(int8=True)`**:
  - A **simplified, high-level** API that allows quick quantization without much effort.
  - Less flexible for adjusting the behavior of individual layers.
  - Works best for **simple model architectures** that don't need special treatment.

## 2. Compatibility

- **Manual Static Quantization**:
  - Adaptable to **various quantization backends** such as TensorRT, QNNPACK, or XNNPACK, ensuring optimal performance on different hardware.
  - Works well with models containing **specialized layers** or operations.

- **`model.export(int8=True)`**:
  - Suitable for **standard models** that don't require extensive customization or backend-specific tuning.
  - May have **limited compatibility** with non-standard architectures.

## 3. Calibration Process

- **Manual Static Quantization**:
  - Requires a **calibration dataset** to collect activation ranges for accurate quantization.
  - The calibration process ensures the model performs well post-quantization.

- **`model.export(int8=True)`**:
  - Uses a **default calibration strategy** internally, which may be less accurate for complex models.

## 4. Backend-Specific Optimization

- **Manual Static Quantization**:
  - Supports **backend-specific optimizations**, such as TensorRT for GPUs or XNNPACK for mobile devices.
  - Allows fine-tuning for **specific deployment targets**.

- **`model.export(int8=True)`**:
  - Provides a **general-purpose quantization**, not fine-tuned for a particular backend.

## When to Use Each Approach

- Use **`model.export(int8=True)`** if:
  - You need a **quick quantization** solution without extensive customization.
  - Your model is simple and doesnâ€™t require backend-specific optimizations.

- Use **manual static quantization** if:
  - You need **precise control** over the quantization process.
  - Your model requires **calibration** for optimal performance.
  - You want to **target specific hardware optimizations**.

## Conclusion

Both methods serve their purpose, with `export(int8=True)` providing convenience for standard models and **manual static quantization** offering greater flexibility for complex models and deployment scenarios. Choose the approach that fits your **model architecture**, **deployment target**, and need for **customization**.
