In C++, the `<<` and `>>` operators are overloaded for both **standard input/output** and **file input/output**, but they might seem reversed at first glance due to the flow of data (stream direction).

1. **Standard Input/Output**

  In standard I/O, the `<<` and `>>` operators function according to the **stream direction**:
  
  - `<<`: Output operator
    - Used with **standard output** (`std::cout`). The left side is the output stream, and the right side is the value to be output.
    - Example: `std::cout << "Hello"` sends `"Hello"` to the output stream.
  
  - `>>`: Input operator
    - Used with **standard input** (`std::cin`). The left side is the input stream, and the right side is the variable where the input is stored.
    - Example: `std::cin >> x` reads from the input stream and stores the value in `x`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> x;  // Reads value from standard input
    cout << "You entered: " << x << endl;  // Outputs the value to standard output
}
```

2. **File Input/Output**

  In file I/O, the same operators are overloaded to work with **file streams**, but the stream direction points to the file:
  
  - `<<`: Output operator
    - Used with **output file streams** (`std::ofstream`). The left side is the file stream, and the right side is the value to be written to the file.
    - Example: `fout << "Hello"` writes `"Hello"` to the file.
  
  - `>>`: Input operator
    - Used with **input file streams** (`std::ifstream`). The left side is the file stream, and the right side is the variable where the input is stored.
    - Example: `fin >> x` reads from the file and stores the value in `x`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream fout("example.txt");
    if (fout.is_open()) {
        fout << "Writing to the file";  // Writes to the file
        fout.close();
    }

    ifstream fin("example.txt");
    string line;
    if (fin.is_open()) {
        fin >> line;  // Reads from the file
        cout << "File content: " << line << endl;
        fin.close();
    }
}
```

3. **Why Does It Seem Reversed?**

  The perceived reversal comes from the **direction of the data flow** in the stream:

  - In **standard output** (`std::cout`), the data flows **from the program to the output stream**, so `<<` is used to send data.
  - In **standard input** (`std::cin`), the data flows **from the input stream to the program**, so `>>` is used to receive data.
  
  Similarly, for file I/O:
  
  - In **output file streams** (`std::ofstream`), `<<` is used to write data **to the file**.
  - In **input file streams** (`std::ifstream`), `>>` is used to read data **from the file**.

  This design stems from C++'s approach of treating I/O as streams, where the direction of the stream determines which operator is used.

4. ðŸ’¡ **Conceptual Understanding of `<<` and `>>`:**

   - `<<`: Think of it as "inserting data **from** a variable **into** the output object."
   - `>>`: Think of it as "extracting data **from** the input object **into** a variable."

   Thus, while `<<` directs the flow of data **from the program to an output object**, `>>` extracts the data **from the input object into a program variable**.
