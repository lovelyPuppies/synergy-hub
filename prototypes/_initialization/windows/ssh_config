### SSH client setting in Windows: VcXsrv (Xlaunch.exe)
## ðŸ”° %shell:pwsh> & "C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe" :0 -multiwindow -ac -clipboard -wgl -nounixkill
# xlaunch.exe: Launches the X server program.
# :0: Sets the display number. Typically, the first display is assigned as :0.
# -multiwindow: Configures the X server to operate in multi-window mode, allowing each X11 application to open as a separate Windows window.
# -ac: Stands for "Access Control." Disables access control, allowing all clients to connect freely to the X server.
# -clipboard: Enables clipboard sharing so that text can be copied and pasted between Windows and X11 applications.
# -wgl: Stands for "Windows Graphics Library." Activates native OpenGL support, allowing X11 applications to render graphics using Windows' OpenGL capabilities.
# -nounixkill: Prevents the Unix-style 'Ctrl + Alt + Backspace' combination from terminating the X server. This helps prevent accidental shutdowns in a Windows environment.
