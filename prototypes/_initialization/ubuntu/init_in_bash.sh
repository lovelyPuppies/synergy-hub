  This is because the standard library packages (like glibc) and compiler packages (like GCC or Clang) are separate in Linux systems.

☑️ Issue: Bug; Why does linuxbrew bin path not take precedence when using fish shell as the default in VSCode remote-SSH? 📅 2024-11-16 12:08:18
  - Environment
    Fish shell was installed using the apt repository or GPG key method for Debian 12.
    The original fish shell was removed, and fish was reinstalled using Homebrew.
    empty: cat ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    empty: ls ~/.config/fish/conf.d/

  - Symptoms
    When connecting to the machine via terminal-based SSH, `echo $PATH` produces the expected result.
    When connecting via VSCode remote-SSH with the default shell set to bash, `echo $PATH` also produces the expected result.
    When connecting via VSCode remote-SSH with the default shell set to fish, `echo $PATH` shows an unexpected result. 
    The original expected `$PATH` is modified, with the `/etc/environment` PATH values being added redundantly to both the start and the end of `$PATH`.
~
  - Solution
    Add the following settings to VSCode `settings.json` file:
    {
      "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "fish",
      "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
        "fish": {
          "path": "/usr/bin/fish" # or "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/fish"
        }
      }
    }
    Then restart VSCode.

  - ❓📰 Remaining Questions
    After applying the above settings once, removing the `"terminal.integrated.profiles.linux"` setting seems to still maintain the corrected behavior. Why?
