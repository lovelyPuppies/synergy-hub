    ⚓ Multiplexing ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing
      In telecommunications and computer networking, multiplexing (sometimes contracted to muxing) is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium.

(Data Transmission)
  ⚓📎🔰 syncword | sync character | sync sequence | preamble ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncword
    ... is used to synchronize a data transmission by indicating the end of header information and the start of data.
      The syncword is a known sequence of data used to identify the 🚣 start of a frame, and is also called 🪱 reference signal or 🪱 midamble 🚣 in wireless communications.
    🪱 Prefix codes allow unambiguous identification of synchronization sequences and may serve as 🪱 self-synchronizing code.

  ⚓📎 Multicast DNS (mDNS) ; << https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS
    ❔ Multicast DNS (mDNS) is a computer networking protocol that resolves hostnames to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a 🪱 local name server.
      📝 A local DNS server is a server which is setup inside of a company or homes network for use by other clients on the network 🔗 https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-local-DNS-server
    💡 It uses IP multicast User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets and is implemented by the 🪱 Apple Bonjour and open-source 🪱 Avahi software packages, included in most Linux distributions.
    
    #️⃣ Protocol overview ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS#Protocol_overview
      ⚖️ By default, mDNS exclusively resolves hostnames ending with the 🪱 .local top-level domain.
    #️⃣📍 Packet structure ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS#Packet_structure
      IPv4 address 224.0.0.251 or IPv6 address ff02::fb
      UDP port 5353
