# Understanding and Resolving PAM `pam_nologin` Errors on Linux Systems

ðŸ“… Written at 2024-11-24 21:45:30

## Overview

The `pam_nologin` error is a common issue on Linux systems, particularly when there are network misconfigurations or incomplete boot processes. This document explores the causes, symptoms, and solutions for this error, with an emphasis on its relation to SSH login and network settings.

## Issue Description

An example of the error message is as follows:

```
System is booting up. Unprivileged users are not permitted to log in yet. Please come back later. For technical details, see pam_nologin(8).
Connection closed by 10.10.14.217 port 22
```

This occurs when attempting to SSH into a Raspberry Pi (or another Linux environment) during or shortly after boot. Despite the login prompt appearing, inputting credentials results in the above permission error.

## Why Network Issues Relate to `pam_nologin`

Network misconfigurations can indirectly cause this error. Here's how:

1. **Boot Dependency on Network Services**

   - If network settings are misconfigured, the system's boot process may not complete successfully.
   - Certain network-dependent services might fail, leading the system to consider the boot incomplete, thereby creating the `/etc/nologin` file. This file blocks non-root user logins.

2. **Interaction with SSH Service**
   - The SSH daemon (`sshd`) uses PAM (`Pluggable Authentication Modules`) for authentication. If network issues prevent `sshd` from initializing properly, PAM will enforce the restrictions defined by the `pam_nologin` module, blocking unprivileged users.

## Solution Steps

### **Temporary Fix**: Bypassing `pam_nologin` Restrictions

1. Access the Raspberry Pi's file system through an SD card reader or alternate means.
2. Navigate to the PAM SSH configuration file:
   ```bash
   /etc/pam.d/sshd
   ```
3. Locate the following line:
   ```plaintext
   account    required     pam_nologin.so
   ```
4. Comment out the line by adding a `#` at the beginning:

   ```plaintext
   #account    required     pam_nologin.so
   ```

   > **Note**: This temporarily disables the login restriction for non-root users and should only be done during debugging.

5. Reload the SSH service to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

### **Long-Term Fix**: Resolving Network Configuration Issues

1. Verify the network settings in configuration files such as:

   - `/etc/network/interfaces`
   - `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`

2. Correct any misconfigurations, such as:

   - Missing or incorrect gateway IPs.
   - DNS resolution issues.
   - Static IP conflicts.

3. Restart the network service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart networking
   ```

4. Ensure the SSH service is running correctly:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status sshd
   ```

## Preventive Measures

- Regularly test network configurations, particularly after making changes.
- Use automated tools to verify system dependencies during boot.
- Avoid disabling `pam_nologin` permanently, as it is a security feature meant to safeguard system integrity during maintenance or incomplete boot states.

## Conclusion

The `pam_nologin` error is closely tied to both system boot status and network configurations. By understanding its interaction with SSH and PAM, users can troubleshoot and resolve the issue efficiently, ensuring stable and secure system operations.
