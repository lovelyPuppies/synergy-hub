  ⚓ Null modem ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_modem
    Null modem is a communication method to directly connect two DTEs (computer, terminal, printer, etc.) using an RS-232 serial cable.
  ⚓ Data terminal equipment (DTE) | 데이터 단말 장치 ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_terminal_equipment
    | data processing terminal equipment | tail circuit
    ... is an end instrument that converts user information into signals or reconverts received signals.
      A DTE device communicates with the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE), such as a modem.
      The DTE/DCE classification was introduced by IBM.
  ⚓ Data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE) | 데이터 회선 종단 장치 ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_circuit-terminating_equipment
    | data communication(s) equipment | data carrier equipment
    ...  is a device that sits between the data terminal equipment (DTE) and a data transmission circuit. 
      Usually, the DTE device is the terminal (or computer), and the DCE is a modem.

        #️⃣ Physical interface ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232#Physical_interface
          In RS-232, user data is sent as a time-series of bits.
          📈 Both synchronous and asynchronous transmissions are supported by the standard. ...
          Each data or control circuit only operates in one direction, that is, signaling from a DTE to the attached DCE or the reverse. Because transmit data and receive data are separate circuits, the interface can operate in a full duplex manner, supporting concurrent data flow in both directions. The standard does not define character framing within the data stream or character encoding.

 ⚓ Multidrop bus (MDB) ; << https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidrop_bus
    A multidrop bus (MDB) is a computer bus able to connect three or more devices.
    🗒️ Contents
      A process of arbitration determines which device sends information at any point.
      📈 Multidrop buses have the advantage of simplicity and extensibility
      📉 , but their differing electrical characteristics make them relatively unsuitable for high frequency or high bandwidth applications.
