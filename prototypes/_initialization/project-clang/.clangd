#ðŸ§ªðŸ“µ ðŸš£ Both (`clangd` and the `C/C++` VSCode extension) in both (ðŸš£ Makefile with compiledb and CMakeLists.txt), clang version installed from both (ðŸš£ homebrew (19.1.7), apt)
#  create many intelliSense errors ðŸš£ only for C++ targets (but ðŸš£ compile successfully).
# When compile if the include path is not added, it automatically explores candidate GCC installations and selects the GCC installation to complement header files.
#   I think the reason why compilation with the prepended path does not fail is that during compilation, clang automatically falls back, but `compile_commands.json` does not do that.
# You can test by running the command `clang++-19 -stdlib=libc++ -I/usr/lib/llvm-19/include/c++/v1 -v cpp.cpp`
# It seems that this issue arises because LLVM's library is not yet fully complete.
