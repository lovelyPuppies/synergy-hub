  * PWM Mode
    ▷ PWM frequency (f_PWM):
      f_PWM = 1 / T_PWM               // Frequency_PWM
    ▷ PWM period (T_PWM):
      T_PWM = (ICR3 + 1) * T_timer    // Time_timer
      // where T_PWM is the period of the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal.

    ▷ Timer clock period (T_timer):
      T_timer = 1 / f_timer
    ▷ Timer clock frequency (f_timer):
      f_timer = f_CPU / N
      // where N is the prescaler value

    = Final PWM frequency formula:
      f_PWM = f_timer / (ICR3 + 1)
      f_PWM = (f_CPU / N) / (ICR3 + 1)
      f_PWM = f_CPU / (N * (ICR3 + 1))

    Example:
      ATmega128 clock frequency f_CPU = 16MHz
      Prescaler N = 64
      Target frequency f_PWM = 1kHz

      f_PWM = 1kHz = 1000Hz

      1000 = 16,000,000 / (64 * (ICR3 + 1))
      1000 * 64 * (ICR3 + 1) = 16,000,000
      64 * (ICR3 + 1) = 16,000
      ICR3 + 1 = 250
      ICR3 = 249

      Therefore, setting ICR3 to 249 will yield a frequency of 1kHz.

    * Description
      1. Role of ICR value
        ICR (Input Capture Register) value sets the period of the PWM signal.
        The larger the ICR value, the longer the PWM period; the smaller the ICR value, the shorter the PWM period.
        For example, if the ICR value is 249, the PWM signal repeats every 250 clock cycles.
      2. Role of Duty Cycle
        OCR (Output Compare Register) value sets the duty cycle.
        The duty cycle represents the proportion of time the signal is "ON" during the PWM period.
        For example, if the duty cycle is 50%, the fan is active for 50% of the time.
