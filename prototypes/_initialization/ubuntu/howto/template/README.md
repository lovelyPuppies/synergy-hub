# Template Folder

📅 Written at 2024-11-23 21:07:28

📍 Note that This folder contains **template scripts** that are not meant to be executed directly.

🔧 Instead, these scripts are provided as a base for customization. Users are expected to modify the files by editing predefined values or adding their own configuration to suit their specific needs.

### About ✏️

Any section marked with the ✏️ emoji indicates a part of the script that requires user attention. Review and update these sections to ensure the script works in your specific environment.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Script**: Open the `.fish` script and review the available variables or placeholders that require customization.
2. **Edit the Script**: Look for ✏️ markers within the script and modify the corresponding values to fit your environment. This might include changing paths, adding parameters, or adjusting other configuration settings.
3. **Save and Execute**: After making the necessary changes, save the file and execute it as a regular `.fish` script.

## Example Usage

1. Navigate to the `template` folder:
   ```bash
   cd howto/template
   ```
2. Open the script with a text editor:
   ```bash
   code example.fish
   ```
3. ✏️ Look for the markers within the script and update any placeholders or configuration values as instructed in the comments.
4. Save your changes and run the script:
   ```bash
   fish example.fish
   ```

## Notes

- These scripts are intentionally designed to require manual configuration to avoid unintended usage.
- ✏️ Always double-check and modify sections marked with the emoji before execution to ensure the script behaves as expected.
- If you encounter issues, refer to the comments within the script or consult the project's documentation.

## Folder Purpose

The `template` folder is intended for **configurable and customizable scripts** that serve as a starting point for specific use cases. These are not "plug-and-play" scripts; instead, they act as guides or frameworks for tailored solutions.
