function list_physical_interfaces
    : '    
    This function lists all physical network interfaces by excluding virtual ones.
    It uses `find` to traverse the /sys/class/net directory with specific conditions.

    üö£ Each line (item) applies the result of the OR condition (`-o`).
    If an interface is a symbolic link pointing to "*virtual*", it is pruned (skipped from further search).
    Otherwise, the name of the interface is printed using `-printf`.

    üö¶ Explanation of `-lname`:
    The `-lname` option in `find` matches symbolic links whose target path matches a specific pattern.
    In this case, it matches links whose target paths contain "virtual". 
    If the link points to such a target, it indicates a virtual interface (e.g., `tailscale0` or `lo`).
    
    üö¶ Note on `-prune` and `-o`:
    - The `-prune` option **stops the search** for any matching items, preventing further traversal into those paths.
    - **However, `-prune` alone does not control whether the matched items are displayed.**
    - To exclude the pruned items from being printed, the **`-o` (OR) condition must be used**.
    - In this function, the `-o` ensures that only non-virtual interfaces are printed.
