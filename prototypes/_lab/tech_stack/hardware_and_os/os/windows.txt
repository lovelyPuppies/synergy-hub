  ⚓📎 Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution
    ❔ The Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a protocol based on the Domain Name System (DNS) packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link.
    
    LLMNR is defined in RFC 4795 but was not adopted as an IETF standard.
      As of April 2022, Microsoft has begun the process of phasing out both LLMNR and NetBIOS name resolution in favour of mDNS. 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution#cite_note-4
