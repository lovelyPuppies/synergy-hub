# Discussion Summary: LSTM/GRU vs. Transformer-based Models for Action Recognition

## Question: Are LSTM/GRU models still commonly used for action recognition, or are Transformer-based models preferred nowadays? If so, why? Is there a significant difference in accuracy or resource consumption?

### 1. **Current Preference for Transformer-based Models**

#### a. **Performance (Accuracy)**
- **LSTM/GRU** models were widely used for **temporal pattern recognition** in the past, including action recognition. However, they have limitations in capturing **long-term dependencies**, especially in handling **long sequences**. This is because they may forget past information as the sequence length increases.
- **Transformer-based models**, on the other hand, utilize the **Self-Attention mechanism** to consider the interaction between all input frames, irrespective of sequence length. This allows them to capture **long-term dependencies** better and handle **longer video sequences** or **more complex actions** with greater accuracy.

#### b. **Parallel Processing Advantage**
- **LSTM/GRU** models process data sequentially, meaning they rely on the output of the previous time step for the next calculation, making **parallel processing** difficult. This creates a bottleneck in terms of **training speed** and **inference speed**.
- **Transformer-based models** can process the input data all at once through the **Self-Attention mechanism**, enabling **parallel processing**. This provides a significant advantage in **training speed** and **inference speed**, especially for **large datasets** or **long sequences**.

#### c. **Accuracy and Performance**
- **Transformer-based models** have shown **higher performance** in tasks like **video recognition** and **action recognition**, as they learn **both spatial and temporal information** simultaneously. They analyze not only the information in each frame but also the **interaction between frames**, leading to more precise predictions.
- Recent research shows that **Transformer-based models** consistently outperform LSTM/GRU models in terms of **accuracy** for action recognition tasks.

### 2. **LSTM/GRU vs. Transformer-based Models: Resource Consumption Comparison**

#### a. **Memory and Computational Resources**
- **LSTM/GRU** models, due to their sequential nature, tend to use **less memory** and require fewer computational resources. For **short sequences** or **simpler actions**, they can still be efficient.
- **Transformer-based models** inherently require **more memory** and **computational resources** due to the **Self-Attention mechanism**. The computational complexity grows rapidly with sequence length.

#### b. **Efficiency**
- Despite the higher resource demands, **Transformer-based models** can still be **efficient** thanks to their ability to process input **in parallel**, making them more suitable for **real-time processing** with optimized hardware environments.

### 3. **Why Are Transformer-based Models Becoming the Standard?**

#### a. **Handling Complex Actions**
- While **LSTM/GRU** models perform well for **simpler actions** or **shorter sequences**, **Transformer-based models** excel when it comes to **complex actions** or **long sequences**, which are often required for action recognition tasks like **traffic signal gestures**.
- For example, in scenarios where **multiple gestures** are performed in succession, or where the **interaction between multiple joints** (spatial complexity) is important, Transformers can better capture the intricacies.

#### b. **Optimized Lightweight Models**
- Newer **lightweight Transformer models** are being developed to perform well even in **resource-constrained environments**, making them competitive with LSTM/GRU in terms of resource consumption. Models like **EfficientFormer** and **TinyBERT** are optimized to use less memory while maintaining high accuracy.

### 4. **Long Sequences and Complex Actions: What Defines Them?**

#### a. **Long Sequences (Temporal Length)**
- A **long sequence** typically refers to actions that span **5 seconds or more**, or **multiple consecutive actions**.
  - **Example**: A traffic officer stops a car and then signals it to proceed, involving **multiple actions** over a few seconds.
  - Technically, **150 or more frames** need to be processed at **30 frames per second** for a ðŸš£ 5-second action.

#### b. **Complex Actions (Gesture Complexity)**
- **Simple actions** involve only **one gesture** or **single-joint movements**.
  - **Example**: Raising a hand to signal stop.
  - Technically, tracking a single joint (e.g., hand or wrist) can be sufficient.

- **Complex actions** involve **multiple joints** moving simultaneously or **composite gestures**.
  - **Example**: A traffic officer signals stop with one hand while pointing with the other, possibly involving body rotation.
  - This requires tracking **multiple joints** (shoulders, elbows, wrists, head) and capturing **spatial interactions** between them.

### 5. **LSTM/GRU vs. Transformer for Action Recognition: Summary**

- **LSTM/GRU**: Suitable for **short sequences** or **simple actions**, but struggles with **long-term dependencies** and **complex actions**. Sequential nature limits **parallel processing** and speed.
- **Transformer-based Models**: Better at handling **long sequences** and **complex actions** due to **Self-Attention**. They enable **parallel processing**, making them faster and more efficient in **real-time tasks**, especially with optimized hardware.
- As a result, **Transformer-based models** are becoming the go-to choice for **action recognition**, even in **resource-constrained environments** like edge devices, thanks to lightweight optimizations.
