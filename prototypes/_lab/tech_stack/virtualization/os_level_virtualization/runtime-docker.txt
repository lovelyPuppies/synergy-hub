            "Driver": "default",

            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"

    ❔ Subnet mask
      Subnet mask is the criterion for dividing network and host addresses.
        /16 → The first 16 bits represent the network, and the remaining 16 bits represent the host.
        /24 → The first 24 bits represent the network, and the remaining 8 bits represent the host.
      🛍️ e.g. 
        Network range: 172.17.0.0 to 172.17.255.255.
        Usable host IPs: 172.17.0.1 to 172.17.255.254 (excluding network and broadcast addresses).
        Number of IPs: /16 contains a total of 65,536 IP addresses (2^16).

      Network range summary:
      CIDR       Subnet Mask      IP Range                        Usable Host IPs
      /16        255.255.0.0      172.17.0.0 ~ 172.17.255.255     65,534
      /24        255.255.255.0    10.10.14.0 ~ 10.10.14.255       254
      /32        255.255.255.255  Single IP (e.g., 10.10.14.19)   1
        
    ❔ 🪱 CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
      CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
      It is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets.
      📍 CIDR replaced the older system of IP address classes (Class A, B, C, etc.) and introduced a more flexible and efficient way of managing IP addresses.
