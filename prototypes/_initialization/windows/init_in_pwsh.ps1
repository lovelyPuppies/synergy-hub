  Notes
  -----
  Since Scoop uses pwsh.exe internally, to update PowerShell Core itself,
  run `scoop update pwsh` from Windows PowerShell, i.e. powershell.exe.

  Add PowerShell Core as a explorer context menu by running:
  '$HOME\scoop\apps\pwsh\current\install-explorer-context.reg'
  For file context menu, run '$HOME\scoop\apps\pwsh\current\install-file-context.reg'

##### Custom packages
# DotNet
scoop install main/dotnet-sdk
