# Temp Folder

ðŸ“… Written at 2024-11-28 22:31:06

The `temp` folder is designated for storing temporary files, serving as a lightweight cache for conducting the smallest unit tests or experiments.

## Purpose

Files in this directory act as an intermediary storage:

- They facilitate small-scale testing or processing tasks.
- These files are temporary by nature and should not be treated as permanent storage.

## Important Notes

1. **Temporary Nature**: Files in the `temp` folder are cleared or re-initialized when their purpose is completed, especially after the information has been understood or documented elsewhere.
2. **Role as Cache**: It operates similar to a CPU cache, holding data for short-term, high-speed access during specific operations.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use this folder strictly for temporary, non-critical files.
- Ensure that all critical or long-term data is saved in a more permanent location.
- Do not store sensitive information as this folder is meant to be frequently overwritten.
