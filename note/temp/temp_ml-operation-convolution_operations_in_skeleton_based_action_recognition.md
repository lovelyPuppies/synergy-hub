# Convolutional Operations in Skeleton-based Action Recognition

### 1. Role of Convolution in Skeleton-based Action Recognition (Relationship with Layers)

In skeleton-based action recognition, **convolutions** are applied to extract both **spatial** and **temporal features** from input skeleton data, such as joint positions, velocity, and bone information. These features are crucial for understanding and recognizing movements over time.

- The **structure of convolution layers** and **type of filters** (e.g., Depth-wise, Point-wise) used in each layer determine how spatial and temporal relationships between skeleton joints are captured.
  - For example, Depth-wise Convolution followed by Point-wise Convolution allows the model to efficiently capture the independent movement of joints while combining their information in later stages.

- **Relationship between Layers and Filters**:
  - In skeleton-based action recognition, a single **layer** may consist of multiple types of convolutions to focus on different aspects (e.g., Spatial Graph Convolution (SGC) for spatial patterns, Temporal Convolution (TC) for temporal changes).
  - As layers become deeper, models capture more complex patterns such as coordinated joint movements and multi-frame temporal dependencies, helping to identify complex actions like running or jumping.

### 2. Explanation of the Types of Input Data in Skeleton-based Action Recognition

In skeleton-based action recognition, the input data consists of **Joint Positions**, **Velocity**, and **Bone Information**. Each type of data serves a specific purpose and contributes uniquely to understanding the movement patterns:

- **Joint Positions**:
  - This data represents the **3D coordinates (X, Y, Z)** of each joint in the skeleton. It indicates the position of each body part (e.g., elbows, knees, shoulders) in 3D space.
  - This information is essential for understanding the overall pose of the subject in each frame and how the pose changes over time.

- **Velocity**:
  - Velocity refers to the **rate of change** of joint positions over time. It provides information about how quickly and in what direction each joint is moving between consecutive frames.
  - By including velocity information, the model can learn not just the static positions of joints, but also their dynamic behavior, such as the speed and acceleration of movements.

- **Bone Information**:
  - Bone information captures the **relative position and orientation** between connected joints. It includes the **length** and **angle** between joints to describe the relationship between body parts (e.g., the distance between the shoulder and the elbow).
  - This data is important for understanding the spatial structure of the body and how the joints are connected, providing additional context to the model about the pose configuration.

### 3. Filters in Skeleton-based Action Recognition

In skeleton-based action recognition, **filters** are weights that operate on the input skeleton data (Joint Positions, Velocity, Bone) to extract spatial and temporal patterns. The filters are designed to recognize and learn movement patterns specific to actions.

- **Structure of Filters**:
  - Filters are **weight matrices** that convolve over the input data to extract features. In skeleton-based models, filters are applied to each channel (e.g., Joint Positions) and its sub-channels (e.g., X, Y, Z coordinates).
  - These filters may be 1D or 2D, depending on whether they are designed to capture temporal patterns (over frames) or spatial patterns (across joints).

- **Application of Filters**:
  - **Depth-wise Convolution**: Each sub-channel (e.g., X, Y, Z of Joint Positions) is processed independently. Filters in this case act on the temporal dimension of each coordinate independently, learning how each joint moves over time.
  - **Point-wise Convolution**: After applying Depth-wise Convolution, Point-wise Convolution (1x1) integrates information across sub-channels. Filters here combine the X, Y, and Z information to understand how different coordinates interact and influence one another.

### 4. Explanation of (a), (b), (c) in Fig. 4 for Skeleton-based Action Recognition

#### **(a) Standard Convolution Operation**

- **Input**: $(C_{\text{in}}, T, V)$ where:
  - $C_{\text{in}}$: Input channels (e.g., Joint Positions, Velocity, Bone).
  - $T$: Temporal dimension (frames).
  - $V$: Number of joints (vertices in the skeleton). This applies to all input channels since each channel provides data specific to each joint.

- **Filter**: $(D_k \times D_k \times C_{\text{out}})$
  - The filter processes all channels simultaneously, learning spatial and temporal patterns by aggregating joint information and capturing their interactions over time.

- **Output**: $(C_{\text{out}}, T, V)$
  - This output feature map contains information about joint interactions and their evolution over the sequence of frames, enabling the model to identify complex actions.

#### **(b) Depth-wise Convolution Operation**

- **Input**: $(C_{\text{in}}, T, V)$
  - Each input channel (Joint Positions, Velocity, Bone) and its respective sub-channels (e.g., X, Y, Z for Joint Positions) are processed independently.

- **Filter**: $(D_k \times D_k \times C_{\text{in}})$
  - Each sub-channel has its own $D_k \times D_k$ filter, ensuring that spatial and temporal independence is maintained for each joint coordinate.

- **Output**: $(C_{\text{in}}, T, V)$
  - The number of output channels remains the same as the input, as each sub-channel is processed independently. This maintains efficiency but limits inter-channel integration.

#### **(c) Point-wise Convolution Operation**

- **Input**: $(C_{\text{in}}, T, V)$ (from the output of the Depth-wise Convolution)
  
- **Filter**: $1 \times 1 \times C_{\text{out}}$
  - The 1x1 filter combines information across sub-channels, integrating joint coordinates and their interactions.

- **Output**: $(C_{\text{out}}, T, V)$
  - The output channels ($C_{\text{out}}$) can be customized to expand or reduce the feature dimensions.

### 5. Explanation on Layer and Filter Interactions in Skeleton Data

- **Within the Same Layer**:
  - Filters in a layer can target different joints or groups of joints, learning localized patterns such as the motion of the arms or the coordination between legs.
  - By increasing the number of filters within a layer, the model can capture a wider range of joint patterns, leading to better understanding of various actions.

- **Across Layers**:
  - Filters across layers build upon the outputs of previous layers. The earlier layers focus on basic joint movements (like arm bending), while deeper layers combine these features to recognize complex actions (like jumping).
  - This hierarchical approach enables the model to refine its understanding of actions progressively.

- **Balancing Filters and Efficiency**:
  - Adding more filters enhances the modelâ€™s ability to detect complex patterns but increases computational demands. The use of Depth-wise and Point-wise Convolutions balances accuracy and efficiency, especially for real-time processing.

### 6. Conclusion

- **(a) Standard Convolution**: Processes input skeleton data by considering all channels, learning spatial and temporal relationships simultaneously.
- **(b) Depth-wise Convolution**: Efficiently processes each sub-channel (e.g., X, Y, Z for each joint) independently, maintaining input dimensions but missing inter-channel interactions.
- **(c) Point-wise Convolution**: Combines sub-channel information to form a richer representation, balancing efficiency with the need for comprehensive joint analysis.
