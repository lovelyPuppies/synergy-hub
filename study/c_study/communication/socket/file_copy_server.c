‚ùì About socket(); creates a new socket for communication.
  - domain: `PF_INET`: ü™± Specifies the protocol family as IPv4, indicating that the socket will use IPv4 addresses for communication.
    - This constant represents the ü™± protocol family for IPv4, meaning it will use IPv4 as the communication method.
    - `AF_INET` generally specifies the address family within the `sockaddr` structure, while `PF_INET` indicates the protocol family used by `socket()` itself.
    - In practice, `AF_INET` and `PF_INET` are often used interchangeably, as they refer to the same address space in IPv4 networking.
  - type: `SOCK_STREAM`: ü™± Sets the socket type to `SOCK_STREAM`, primarily used for TCP connections.
    - `SOCK_STREAM` defines a stream-based socket type, providing a reliable, connection-oriented, in-order communication channel.
    - This setup is ideal for TCP, where data integrity and order are critical requirements, enabling the socket to transmit data as a continuous byte stream.
  - protocol: `0`: The protocol is set to 0, allowing the operating system to choose the default protocol
    - By setting `protocol` to `0`, the operating system automatically selects the appropriate default protocol for the specified socket type and protocol family combination.
    - Here, it defaults to TCP for `SOCK_STREAM` in conjunction with `PF_INET` (IPv4), ensuring reliable data transfer.
  This function returns a file descriptor for the newly created socket, or `-1` if an error occurs,
  indicating that the socket could not be successfully created.

‚ùì About memset(); initializes a block of memory to a specified value.
  - `s` (source or start): Pointer to the starting address of the memory block to be set.
    This specifies where in memory the initialization should begin.
  - `c` (character): Value to set, which is treated as an unsigned char and copied into each byte of the specified memory block.
  - `n` (number): Number of bytes to set in the memory block. This determines how many bytes from the starting address `s` will be filled with the value `c`.


‚ùì About struct sockaddr_in
  Reference
    ‚öì sockaddr ; https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sockaddr.3type.html
      Internet domain sockets

  It will use the created the variable name "sin_family" by implementation
  ```cpp
    #define	__SOCKADDR_COMMON(sa_prefix) \
    sa_family_t sa_prefix##family
    struct sockaddr_in
    {
      __SOCKADDR_COMMON (sin_);
      ...
    }
  ```
  ‚ùî The `__SOCKADDR_COMMON` Macro:
    The `__SOCKADDR_COMMON` macro defines fields that are common to all `sockaddr` structures.
    It is used to declare the `sa_family` field with the prefix `sin_`, which becomes `sin_family` when combined.
    The `##` in `sa_prefix##family` is a preprocessor concatenation operator, allowing the macro to prepend `sin_` to `family`, forming `sin_family`.


  Explanation:
    The `struct sockaddr_in` structure is specifically designed for handling IPv4 internet addresses in network programming.
    This structure includes key fields that specify the address family, port number, and IP address.

    Key Fields in `sockaddr_in`:
    - `sin_family`: Specifies the address family allowing the socket to understand the format and nature of the address.
      In this case, `AF_INET` is used to indicate IPv4.
    - `sin_port`: Stores the port number for the socket.
      This value is stored in "network byte order" (big-endian format), as required by network protocols.
    - `sin_addr`: Stores the IP address for the socket, specifically in `sin_addr.s_addr`.

  Additional Details:
    - `AF_INET`: This constant represents the ü™± address family for IPv4. It is used to define the `sin_family` field to ensure the socket knows it will be communicating over IPv4.
    - `INADDR_ANY`: Address to accept any incoming messages.
      This constant is used with `sin_addr.s_addr` to allow the socket to accept connections on any Internet network interface associated with the host (e.g., any available IP address).
      It is converted to network byte order using `htonl`.
    - `htons` and `htonl` (ü™± Host to Network Short/Long):
      Both functions are used to convert values from host byte order
      (which may be little-endian or big-endian depending on the machine) to network byte order (always big-endian).
      This ensures consistency across different networked systems.
    - `atoi` (ü™± ASCII to Integer): Converts a string to an integer.
      In this context, it is used to interpret the port number provided as a command-line argument and convert it from a string to an integer that can be used in `sin_port`.



üìù You must write exception code coressponding with return vlaue of functions.
‚ùî Why client_addr_size, str_len required?
  üìù Answer: `client_addr_size` and `str_len` are needed because, in C, pointers alone do not convey the length or size of the data they reference. 
  Functions like `accept` and `write` require explicit length information to know how much memory to read or write, ensuring safe and correct operation.
