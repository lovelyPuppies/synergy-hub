        Despite the considerable improvem`ents, the settings of different GCN approaches do not align well.
        ... However, existing open-source repositories [3, 13, 18, 23] only implement a single algorithm with their own practices.

      # System requirements
        🚣 Remote SSH host: A running SSH server on: ...
        https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_getting-started
      # Installation
      # SSH host setup
        📍 Optional: If your Linux or macOS SSH host will be accessed by multiple users at the same time
          , consider enabling Remote.SSH: Remote Server Listen On Socket in VS Code User settings for improved security.
        ⚙️📰 Remote.SSH: Remote Server Listen On Socket
          When true, the remote VS Code server will listen on a socket path instead of opening a port.
          ⚖️ Only valid for Linux and macOS remotes.
          After toggling this setting, run the command "Kill VS Code Server on Host..." for it to take effect.
          Requires OpenSSH 6.7.
          Disables dynamic port forwarding and "local server" mode.
          Requires AllowStreamLocalForwarding to be enabled for the SSH server.

    #️⃣ Opening a terminal on a remote host
      # SSH host-specific settings
        📄 ~/.vscode-server/data/Machine

    #️⃣📍 Working with local tools
      The Remote - SSH extension does not provide direct support for sync'ing source code or using local tools with content on a remote host. However, there are two ways to do this using common tools that will work with most Linux hosts.
      Specifically, you can:
        Mount the remote filesystem using SSHFS.
        Sync files to/from the remote host to your local machine using rsync.
      
      SSHFS is the most convenient option and does not require any file sync'ing. However, performance will be significantly slower than working through VS Code
      ⭕, so it is best used for single file edits and uploading/downloading content.
      
      If you need to use an application that bulk reads/write to many files at once (like a local source control tool)
      ⭕ , rsync is a better choice.

      # SSH Key-based Authentication

      1. **Public key** goes on the **server**.
      2. **Private key** stays on the **client**.
      3. Server uses the public key to verify the client during SSH connection.
      4. Client keeps the private key safe and never uploads it to the server.

        # Local / Remote Host: ...

    #️⃣ Picking your quick start ; https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_picking-your-quick-start
    #️⃣ Quick start: Try a development container ; https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-try-a-development-container
    #️⃣💡 Quick start: Open an existing folder in a container ; https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container
      ⚠️ While using this approach to bind mount the local filesystem into a container is convenient, it does have some performance overhead on Windows and macOS
      # Open a WSL 2 folder in a container on Windows
      # Open a folder on a remote SSH host in a container
      # Open a folder on a remote Tunnel host in a container
      # Open an existing workspace in a container
        ... if the workspace only references relative paths to sub-folders of the folder the .code-workspace file is in (or the folder itself).
    #️⃣💡 Quick start: Open a Git repository or GitHub PR in an isolated container volume ; https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume
      ⭕ In addition to not polluting your file tree, local volumes have the added benefit of improved performance on Windows and macOS

      ⚖️ Note: Additional configuration will already be added to the container based on what's in the base image. ...

      # "Always installed" Features
      # Creating your own Feature
      # Features specification and distribution
    #️⃣💡 Pre-building dev container images ; https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_prebuilding-dev-container-images
      📝 The core idea: 
        The relationship between metadata and embedded image information means that configurations embedded within the image are automatically applied in Dev C`ontainers. 
        📍 This approach eliminates the need to maintain complex configuration files locally, as the necessary settings are embedded in metadata and automatically applied when the image is referenced.

        Key Reasons for Using Metadata-Embedded Dev Containers:
          - Consistent Environments: Every time the image is referenced, the embedded settings ensure identical environments.
          - Simplified Configuration Management: Metadata embedded in images eliminates the need for maintaining complex local configuration files.
          
          - Reduced Maintenance: Updates are handled by rebuilding the image, not by manually editing configuration files across projects.
          
          - Reusability Across Projects: The same image can be reused in multiple repositories or pipelines without reconfiguration.
          
          - Integration with CI/CD: Ensures seamless, reproducible environments in automated workflows like GitHub Actions or DevOps pipelines.

      ⭕ We recommend pre-building images with the tools you need rather than creating and building a container image each time you open your project in a dev container.
        Using pre-built images will result in a faster container startup, simpler configuration, and allows you to pin to a specific version of tools to improve supply-chain security and avoid potential breaks.
      ...🚣 to improve supply-chain security and avoid potential breaks. 
      ... Even better - pre-built images can contain Dev Container metadata ...
      ⭕ We recommend using the Dev Container CLI (or other specification supporting utilities like the GitHub Action) to pre-build your images since it is kept in sync with the Dev Containers extension's latest capabilities - including dev container Features.

    #️⃣⚖️ Managing extensions ; https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_managing-extensions
      While extensions that affect the VS Code UI, like themes and snippets, are installed locally, most extensions will reside inside a particular container
      There will be a Local - Installed category and also one for your container.

      #💡 Adding an extension to devcontainer.json
      #🚣 Opt out of extensions
      #📍 "Always installed" extensions
        If there are extensions that you would like always installed in any container, you can update the dev.containers.defaultExtensions User setting. 
      # Advanced: Forcing an extension to run locally or remotely
        Typically, this should only be used for testing unless otherwise noted in the extension's documentation since it can break extensions.

      - 📰 All roots/folders in a multi-root workspace will be opened in the same container, regardless of whether there are configuration files at lower levels.
      - The unofficial Ubuntu Docker snap package for Linux is not supported.
      - 📰 If you clone a Git repository using SSH and your SSH key has a passphrase, VS Code's pull and sync features may hang when running remotely. Either use an SSH key without a passphrase, clone using HTTPS, or run git push from the command line to work around the issue.
      - 📰 Local proxy settings are not reused inside the container, which can prevent extensions from working unless the appropriate proxy information is configured (for example global HTTP_PROXY or HTTPS_PROXY environment variables with the appropriate proxy information).

    # What are development containers?
    # A structured metadata format
      🚣 It is a structured JSON with Comments (jsonc) metadata format that tools can use to store any needed configuration required to develop inside of local or cloud-based containerized coding.
      💡 Since the spec was initally published, dev container metadata can now be stored in image labels and in reusable chunks of metadata and install scripts known as Dev Container Features.
